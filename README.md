# github_API
 github API project
 
 Part 1 (interrogating Github API) - this is in the github_API R file, I have interrogated the API to extract info about my own repos. All code from this part was sourced from https://towardsdatascience.com/accessing-data-from-github-api-using-r-3633fb62cb08
 
 Part 2 - I used Plot.ly to create 3 different visualizations from a population of users who are followers of the second most active Github user: andrew. 
 
 My first visualization uses a regular plot of 52 user's repositories against the number of people who are following. I was expecting a more linear relationship, yet there seemed to be no correlation between the two. 
 
 My second visualization was a pie chart of the 5 most popular languages used within these users' repositories. Ruby was by far the most popular language. I had never seen or used this language before so this result interested me. 
 
 My final visualization was a scatter plot of users with over 1000 followers against the number of people they are following.
